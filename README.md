# Personal Portfolio

This portfolio was initially completed as part of the onboarding for the VetsWhoCode March 2022 Romeo Golf cohort.

It has since been refactored and improved into the version you see today.

Here we each built our own portfolio utilizing HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Over time we made our portfolios both more accessible and better performing.
